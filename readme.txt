== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What this plugin for? =

Momtaz Nmwdhj is an API for creating forms elements via code.

= Why I build the Momtaz Nmwdhj? =

In the past creating the meta-boxes/theme-settings options or even the front-end forms, was dirty,hard and heavy!

I searched for a good/clean/easy library to build the HTML forms easily, to make my theme/plug-in Forms more clever and elegant!, but unfortunately most the plug-ins I found was very complicated and hard to develop, I start thinking to use the 'Zend Forms' but the idea of loading the Zend Framework just to use the Zend Forms looks like a stupid idea!

So I started to build my own plug-in, I focused to made it easy,simple and fast!
